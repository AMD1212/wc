# wc
This script is a wrapper for the wc binary printing WC (lavatory) ascii art before doing the work

## Installation:
 TBD - provide a fast and easy revertible way to install it on computers of coworkers not locking them when leaving the room.


## Usage: wc [OPTIONS]

### Options:
    -l          Shows a urinal
    -c          Shows a cat-litter box
    -w          Reminds you to wash your hands
    -m          Displays a fancy monkey throwing poop

Without a option the script shows a fancy lavatory.

The cool ascii arts are written to STDERR so the wrapper script should not break scripts using wc.

Have fun!
